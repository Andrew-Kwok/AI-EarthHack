93,"Despite the success of some Deposit Return Systems, many industries still struggle to manage packaging waste. This problem is amplified by the lack of consumer awareness and participation, the high initial investment for businesses, and the infrastructural challenges.  ","The solution I propose is a digitally-enabled Deposit Return System (DRS) which uses modern technology, like QR codes or RFID tags, in packaging to track and incentivize returns. Using an app, consumers can easily locate return points and track their potential refunds, thus increasing participation.   For businesses, the digital interface provides data on consumer behavior, trends, and return rates, enabling them to optimize packaging resources and potentially reduce waste management costs. Above all, the digital DRS could drive economic and environmental benefits by transforming the one-way packaging chain into a circular economy model.   This solution offers scalability and feasibility by being adaptable to different packaging types and industries, and because the majority of the population now owns a smartphone, it can be practically implemented at a global scale. Moreover, it doesn't necessarily require hefty infrastructural investments from businesses as it leverages existing recycling facilities and communication networks. Therefore, it enhances participation, reducibg waste, while making it feasibly scalable, and financially attractive."
