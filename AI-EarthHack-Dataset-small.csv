2,"'Fast Fashion' Encourages Textile Waste and Overconsumption: The current fashion industry operates under a 'take, make, dispose' model, which encourages overconsumption and creates a huge amount of textile waste, contributing to environmental pollution and resource depletion.   ","Introduction of a Sustainable Clothing Rental and Recycling Business: This idea incorporates the use of digital platforms to allow customers to lease, rather than buy, high-quality and fashionable clothing items. This reduces the overall demand for new clothing production and thus, textile waste. Additionally, worn-out or returned clothes could be refurbished for further use or responsibly recycled to create new materials. This approach also encourages the conscious consumption of fashion, which can contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals and society by creating a culture of mindful shopping."
