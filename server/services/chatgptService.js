p = "Problem: The majority of the materials used in producing electronic goods are not being utilized optimally. Numerous electronic devices are replaced before their lifespan ends, often due to minor malfunctioning or outdated components, resulting in significant production of electronic waste and underutilization of natural resources.  Solution: An innovative concept would be a modular electronic device model where users are able to upgrade or swap components, rather than replacing the entire device, thus promoting a circular economy. This goes beyond just restoration but rather the idea of creating an electronic gadget that thrives on reuse and modifications, maximising the life and value of each part.   Manufacturers need to design gadgets with modules for core components, allowing for easy upgrades or replacements. For instance, a smartphone could have individually upgradeable components: camera, battery, CPU, etc. When a module fails or becomes outdated, only that module needs to be replaced.  This idea promotes resource use efficiency and significantly cuts waste, under the 'reduce, reuse, repair' mantra. The replaced modules should be sent back to manufacturers for refurbishment or extraction of critical raw materials.   For businesses it opens a new market space, enabled by sale of modules and recycled components, providing long term value capture. It also increases customer loyalty as they continually engage with the manufacturers in the lifecycle of their device. The model is scalable as it allows for the continuous incorporation of technological advancements within the same core device.   This modular approach is not only novel but it clearly addresses the broader picture of how electronic devices should be designed for a circular economy, considering environmental protection, resource efficiency, economic viability, and customer value."
