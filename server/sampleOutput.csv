The fashion industry contributes about 10% of global CO2 emissions, with fast fashion being the major contributor. Fast fashion leads to the creation of end-of-life waste, where 85% of textile waste ends up in landfills or is incinerated. Furthermore, the industries involved in the production of fast-fashion are found in developing countries where workers face poor working conditions, and economies struggle due to rising waste management costs.  ;""Full Turn Fashion"" is a comprehensive circular economy model designed to tackle fashion waste and pollution. Ushering the paradigm shift from usual 'produce-use-dispose' to 'reduce-reuse-recycle, we encourage consumers to return their worn-out clothing which we will collect, sort and recycle into unique, locally produced garments. Wastes unsuitable for direct recycling will be decomposed to produce organic dyes and materials. Operating specifically within fast-fashion importing countries, these processes involve local SMEs and communities, promoting local economy growth and creating jobs. Financial feasibility is achieved through revenue from the sale of upcycled apparel and premium value added to Geographical Indication. Our model is scalable, with potential for network expansion across other fast-fashion importing countries, steering the global fashion industry towards sustainability.;Valid;8.0;The issue is globally recognized and the explanation is detailed, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the fast fashion industry.;7.0;The user has identified a significant problem with clear implications for both the environment and human rights.;8.2;The user effectively highlights the urgency of the problem, providing specific details about the environmental and social impacts of the fast fashion industry.;7.0;The user has identified a significant problem, namely the environmental and economic impact of the fast fashion industry.;7.0;The user has identified a significant problem in the fashion industry, specifically fast fashion, which contributes to global CO2 emissions and creates a large amount of waste.;8.0;The "Full Turn Fashion" solution presents a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem of waste and pollution in the fashion industry.;7.8;The "Full Turn Fashion" concept aligns well with the principles of the circular economy, particularly in maintaining high-value material cycles and maximizing resource use.;7.0;The proposed solution, "Full Turn Fashion," is a commendable approach to address the issue of waste and pollution in the fashion industry.;7.0;The "Full Turn Fashion" model presents a promising approach to tackling the environmental and economic issues associated with fast fashion.;7.0;The idea of "Full Turn Fashion" is commendable and aligns well with the principles of circular economy and sustainability.;EcoTrend Cycle;Materials;"Full Turn Fashion" is a circular economy model aimed at reducing fashion waste and pollution by encouraging consumers to return worn-out clothing for recycling into new garments, promoting local economies, and steering the global fashion industry towards sustainability.
